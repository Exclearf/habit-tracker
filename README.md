# habit-tracker

Simple CRUD application in C#. 

## Challenges

 - The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
 - When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isnâ€™t present.
 - The app should show the user a menu of options.
 - The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
 - The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
 - Interact with the database using raw SQL.
 
**Looking forward to practice more**
